<h1>Reading Diagnostics-Miscue Analysis</h1>
<p>I have heard some parents say, “My child can read pretty well, but she doesn’t understand what she just read.” If a child or adult is not <i>comprehending</i>, then no reading is taking place. A reader may be “decoding” the text smoothly, but <i>reading</i> involves <ins>comprehension</ins>.</p>
<p>There exist a variety of stumbling blocks that inhibit good reading comprehension.</p>
<h2>Types of Errors</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Graphophonetic error:</b> Preserves some important phonetics of the written word, even if it does not make sense (e.g., written word is “friend,” but spoken word is “fried’).</li>
  <li><b>Syntactic error:</b> Preserves the grammar of the written word (e.g., “ran” is the same part of speech as “jogged”).</li>
  <li><b>Semantic error:</b> Preserves the meaning of the sentence (e.g., “the woman is tall” has the same meaning as “the lady is tall”).</li>
</ul>
