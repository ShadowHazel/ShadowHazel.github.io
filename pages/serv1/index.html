<h1>Reading Diagnostics-Miscue Analysis</h1>
<p>I have heard some parents say, “My child can read pretty well, but she doesn’t understand what she just read.” If a child or adult is not <i>comprehending</i>, then no reading is taking place. A reader may be “decoding” the text smoothly, but <i>reading</i> involves <ins>comprehension</ins>.</p>
<p>There exist a variety of stumbling blocks that inhibit good reading comprehension.</p>
