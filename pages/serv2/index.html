	<h1>Individually Designed Instruction</h1>
	<p>For each tutoring session, the student will be provided with passages to read aloud. A comprehension test will follow
		each reading. Over time, the student will begin to steadily increase their reading fluency, as well as their comprehension.
		As this process develops, the student will be reading stories of increasing complexity. All materials are tailored to the
		interests, and needs of the individual student.</p>
